# typewired Hugo Blox Theme

[![Screenshot](.github/preview.png)](https://github.com/shaunassam/typewired-template)

<p>
  The <strong>typewired</strong> theme was customized from the <a href="https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv">Hugo Blox Academic CV template</a> created by George Cushen.
</p>

<p>
   This theme initially started as a fun project to learn Hugo by creating a corporate-like web site inspired by the TailBliss design. It was then adapted as a portfolio to showcase my various writing projects, hosted on <a href="https://typewired.com"><strong>typewired.com</strong>.
